Latest version (1.0) was released on 13/12/2015.

##### How to Play
Create a folder "infighter" in your Quake II directory, open it, and place the downloaded .dll in there. 
Start up Quake II and enter "game infighter" into your console. Now simply start the game or type "map q2dm1" and you're done!

To spawn monsters, check out the commands below. Advised is to bind these commands to keyboard keys with the "bind" key. 
For instance, the "inf_nextmon" and "inf_prevmon" commands can be bound to "mwheelup" and "mwheeldown" respectively.
This way you can quickly select monsters simply by scrolling your mouse wheel.

Once you have your selected monster, simply click left mouse button (or whatever key is bound to firing your gun) and your
monster should appear. If you have no monster selected you can fire a death ray. This way you can quickly kill/remove monsters.

##### Commands
The mod uses the following custom commands:

###### inf_fight
> Starts the monster infighting. Will pause the action if they're already fighting.

###### inf_freeze
> Freezes all monsters, projectiles and more. Will unfreeze if used again.

###### inf_skill
> Changes the skill setting of all monsters. A higher skill results in more aggressiveness.

###### inf_nextmon
> Selects the next monster you're attempting to summon.

###### inf_prevmon
> Selects the previous monster.

###### inf_team
> Changes the team of the monster you're trying to spawn.

###### inf_showteams
> Toggles the monster's team colours. They're still teamed up, but the game won't render the coloured shell.

###### inf_clear
> Removes all monsters.

###### inf_ray
> Quickly switch into your death ray. Useful if you don't want to scroll through all monster selections.

###### inf_help
> Lists all Infighter commands in the game.

##### Miscellaneous Info
I wrote a similar mod to this about 5 years ago, but wasn't even nowhere close to how versatile this one is. Each monster had to be spawned by commands, the AI was poor and there were only 2 teams. 

A few days ago I noticed some YouTube videos of Doom and Quake where monsters fought each other gladiator style. The YouTubers even held tournaments and was pretty entertaining, but I couldn't find any Quake II fights, so I wrote this mod which could easily simulate those.

Feel free to make YouTube videos of this mod. In fact, I encourage it! I feel there's some great potential for creative videos.
